      <p class="p-small">
        For the first ten years of my career, I worked for Massimo Vignelli, a
        designer who is legendary for using a very limited number of typefaces.
        Between 1980 and 1990, most of my projects were set in five fonts:
        Helvetica (naturally), Futura, Garamond No. 3, Century Expanded, and, of
        course, Bodoni.
      </p>
      <p class="p-small">
        For Massimo, this was an ideological choice, an ethical imperative. “In
        the new computer age,” he once wrote, “the proliferation of typefaces
        and type mani- pulations represents a new level of visual pollution
        threatening our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are
        a few basic ones, and trash the rest.” For me, it became a time-saving
        device. Why spend hours choosing between Bembo, Sabon and Garamond No. 3
        every time you needed a Venetian Roman? For most people — my mom, for
        instance — these were distinctions without differences. Why not just
        commit to Garamond No. 3 and never think about it again? My Catholic
        school education must have well prepared me for this kind of moral
        clarity. I accepted it gratefully.
      </p>
      <p class="p-small">
        Then, after a decade, I left my first job. Suddenly I could use any
        typeface I wan- ted, and I went nuts. On one of my first projects, I
        used 37 different fonts on 16 pages. My wife, who had attended Catholic
        school herself, found this all too familiar. She remembered classmates
        who had switched to public school after eight years under the nuns:
        freed at last from demure plaid uniforms, they wore the shortest skirts
        they could find. “Jesus,” she said, looking at one of my multiple font
        demolition derbies. “You’ve become a real slut, haven’t you?”
      </p>
      <p class="p-small">
        It was true. Liberated from monogamy, I became typographically
        promiscuous. I have since, I think, learned to modulate my behavior —
        like any substance abuser, I learned that binges are time-consuming,
        costly, and ultimately counterproduc- tive — but I’ve never gone back to
        five-typeface sobriety. Those thousands of typefaces are still out
        there, but my recovery has required that I become more discriminating
        and come up with some answers to this seemingly simple ques- tion: why
        choose a particular typeface? Here are thirteen reasons.
