            Some typefaces are just perfect for certain things. I've specified
            exotic fonts for identity programs that work beautifully in
            headlines and even in text, but sooner or later you have to set that
            really tiny type at the bottom of the business reply card. This is
            what Franklin Gothic is for. Careful, though: some typefaces work
            too well. Frutiger has been used so much for signage programs in
            hospitals and airports that seeing it now makes me feel that I'm
            about to get diagnosed with a brain tumor or miss the 7:00 to
            O'Hare.

            I've heard of several projects where the designer found a font that
            was created the same year the client's organization was founded.
            This must give the recommendation an aura of manifest destiny that
            is positively irresistible. I haven't had that luck yet, but still
            try to find the same kind of evocative alignment. For instance, I
            was never a fan of Aldo Novarese's Eurostyle, but I came to love it
            while working on a monograph on Eero Saarinen: they both share an
            expressiveness peculiar to the postwar optimism of the 1950's.

            Once I saw a project in a student portfolio that undertook the
            dubious challenge of redesigning the Tiffany's identity. I
            particularly disliked the font that was used, and I politely asked
            what it was. "Oh," came the enthusiastic response, "that's the best
            part! It's called Tiffany!" On the other hand, Bruce Mau
            designed Spectacle, the book he created with David Rockwell, using
            the typeface Rockwell. I thought this was funny.

            Once I was working on a project where the client group included some
            very strong-minded architects. I picked Cheltenham, an idiosyncratic
            typeface that was not only well-suited to the project's
            requirements, but was one of the few I know that was designed by an
            architect, Bertram Goodhue. Recently, I designed a publications
            program for a girls' school. I used a typeface that was designed by
            a woman and named after another, Zuzana Licko's Mrs. Eaves. In both
            cases, my clients knew that the public would be completely unaware
            of the story behind the font selection, but took some comfort in it
            nonetheless. I did too.

            Sometimes a typeface is already living on the premises when you show
            up, and it just seems mean to evict it. "We use Baskerville and
            Univers 65 on all our materials, but feel free to make an alternate
            suggestion." Really? Why bother? It's like one of those shows where
            the amateur chef is given a turnip, a bag of flour, a leg of lamb
            and some maple syrup and told to make a dish out of it. Sometimes
            it's something you've never used before, which makes it even more
            fun.

            handy.

            Whenever I want to make words look straightforward, conversational,
            and smart, I frequently consider Futura, upper and lower case. Why?
            Not because Paul Renner was straightforward, conversational, and
            smart, although he might have been. No, it's because 45 years
            ago, Helmut Krone decided to use Futura in Doyle Dane Bernbach's
            advertising for Volkswagen, and they still use it today. One
            warning, however: what reminds you of something may remind someone
            else of something else.

            About 10 years ago, I was asked to redesign the logo for New
            York magazine. Milton Glaser had based the logo on Bookman Swash
            Italic, a typeface I found unimaginably dated and ugly. But Glaser's
            logo had replaced an earlier one by Peter Palazzo that was based on
            Caslon Italic. I proposed we return to Caslon, and distinctly
            remember saying, "Bookman Swash Italic is always going to look
            ugly." The other day, I saw something in the office that really
            caught my eye. It was set in Bookman Swash Italic, and it looked
            great. Ugly, but great.

            Tibor Kalman was fascinated with boring typefaces. "No, this one is
            too clever, this one is too interesting," he kept saying when showed
            him the fonts I was proposing for his monograph. Anything but a
            boring typeface, he felt, got in the way of the ideas. We settled on
            Trade Gothic.

            In design as in fashion, nothing beats bespoke tailoring. I've
            commissioned custom typefaces from Jonathan Hoefler and Tobias
            Frere-Jones and Joe Finocchiaro, and we're currently working
            with Matthew Carter and Chester. It is the ultimate indulgence, but
            well worth the extra effort. Is this proliferation? I say bring it
            on.

            Sometimes I think that Massimo Vignelli may be using
            too many typefaces, not too few. A true fundamentalist requires a
            monotheistic worldview: one world, one typeface. The designers
            at Experimental Jetset have made the case for Helvetica. My partner
            Abbott Miller had a period of life he calls "The Scala Years" when
            he used that typeface almost exclusively. When the time is right, I
            might make that kind of commitment myself.

            Princeton Architectural Press is about to publish a collection of
            essays I've written, many of which first appeared here on Design
            Observer. I wanted it to feel like a real book for readers — it has
            no pictures — so I asked Abbott to design it. He suggested we set
            each one of the 79 pieces in a different typeface. I loved this
            idea, but wasn't sure how far he'd want to go with it. "What about
            the one called 'I Hate ITC Garamond?'" I asked him. "Would we set it
            in ITC Garamond?" He looked at me as if I was crazy. "Of course," he
            said.
